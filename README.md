# Woah.

> *so, who are you?*

Hi, my name is Blu. You might find me in places with the username bluthemeth or, less often, blurple.

Some of these things are probably 90% unnecessary for a *github* account, but keep in mind that this file is linked on my [discord profile](#stuff-that-might-be-important-possibly) and that's the main purpose of it. (*other website that's* not *on github is in the works!!*)

I do stuff, I think. Someone fact check me on this one!

## Things that I do

> *why do you exist?*

Things that I like doing include the following statements:
- codecianing
- musicing
- uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
- writing shit and stuff
- [languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) (and learning existing ones too, obv)

I am working on a few projects, most of which are private.

## Stuff that might be important, possibly

> *why are you weird*

Probably the most important thing that would have to be included in this day and age and for just ease of communication would be that **I am autistic** as fuck :fire: :cold_face:

> *\[literally any personal question\]*

Other things are that I don't usually make public a bunch of information about me just because I like keeping privacy.

> *where can i contact you?*

If you want to contact me you could do so on Discord (@bluthemeth) and that's practically the only chatting platform I'm on really. I'm open to mostly anything and I'll let you know about stuff that I do or don't like, and I can answer questions too ig

Really, AMA lmao
